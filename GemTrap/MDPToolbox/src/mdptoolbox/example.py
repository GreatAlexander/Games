def forest(S=3, r1=4, r2=2, p=0.1, is_sparse=False):
    """Generate a MDP example based on a simple forest management scenario.
    
    This function is used to generate a transition probability
    (``A`` × ``S`` × ``S``) array ``P`` and a reward (``S`` × ``A``) matrix
    ``R`` that model the following problem. A forest is managed by two actions:
    'Wait' and 'Cut'. An action is decided each year with first the objective
    to maintain an old forest for wildlife and second to make money selling cut
    wood. Each year there is a probability ``p`` that a fire burns the forest.
    
    Here is how the problem is modelled.
    Let {1, 2 . . . ``S`` } be the states of the forest, with ``S`` being the 
    oldest. Let 'Wait' be action 1 and 'Cut' action 2.
    After a fire, the forest is in the youngest state, that is state 1.
    The transition matrix P of the problem can then be defined as follows::
        
                   | p 1-p 0.......0  |
                   | .  0 1-p 0....0  |
        P[1,:,:] = | .  .  0  .       |
                   | .  .        .    |
                   | .  .         1-p |
                   | p  0  0....0 1-p |
        
                   | 1 0..........0 |
                   | . .          . |
        P[2,:,:] = | . .          . |
                   | . .          . |
                   | . .          . |
                   | 1 0..........0 |
    
    The reward matrix R is defined as follows::
        
                 |  0  |
                 |  .  |
        R[:,1] = |  .  |
                 |  .  |
                 |  0  |
                 |  r1 |
        
                 |  0  |
                 |  1  |
        R[:,2] = |  .  |
                 |  .  |
                 |  1  |
                 |  r2 |
    
    Parameters
    ---------
    S : int, optional
        The number of states, which should be an integer greater than 0. By
        default it is 3.
    r1 : float, optional
        The reward when the forest is in its oldest state and action 'Wait' is
        performed. By default it is 4.
    r2 : float, optional
        The reward when the forest is in its oldest state and action 'Cut' is
        performed. By default it is 2.
    p : float, optional
        The probability of wild fire occurence, in the range ]0, 1[. By default
        it is 0.1.
    
    Returns
    -------
    out : tuple
        ``out[1]`` contains the transition probability matrix P with a shape of
        (A, S, S). ``out[2]`` contains the reward matrix R with a shape of
        (S, A).
